#### CH 10 DEBUGGING <br>
The console and dev tools : 
* Order of execution: how JS sees a page: 

* If you are anticipating that something in your code may cause an error, you can use a set of statements to handle the error. (p 480) if the error doesn't get resolved, the script will just stop processing. Important to inform users when there is a problem in your handler. 

* the interpreter uses the concept of execution contexts. There is one global execution context, plus, each function creates a new execution context. They correspond to variable scope. 
    * Every statement within a script lives in one of three execution contexts: 
        * Global Context: Code that is in the script, but not in a function. 
            * Corresponds to global scope: a variable declared outside a function, can be used anywhere because it has a global scope.
        * Function context: Code that is being run within a function. 
        * Eval Context (not shown) : Text is executed like code in an internal function ...

* Variables defined in a function are only available in that function. 
* Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity: 
    * prepare :
        * The new scope is created
        * Variables, functions and arguments are created
    * execute
        * Now it can assign values to variables 
        * Reference functions and run their code 
        * Execute statements 
    * Hoisting: 
        * You can  call functions before they have been declared (if they're created using function declarations- not function expressions. page 96) 
        * Assign a value to a variable that has not yet been declared. 
        * You can do this because of the way the interpreter goes through the code- any variables and functions within each execution context are created before they are executed. This all happens within the preparation phase- the interpreter takes all of the variables and functions and hoisting them to the top of the execution context.
        * Each execution context also creates its own variables object. This object contains details of all of the variables, functions, and parameters for that execution context. 
    * Functions in Javascript are said to have lexical scope.
        * They are linked to the object they were defined within. So for each execution context, the scope is the current execution context's variables object, plus the variables object for each parent execution context. 
        * Example: think of each function as a nesting doll. The children can ask the parents for info in their variables. But the parents cannot get variables from their children. Each child will get the same answer from the same parent. 
            * If a variable isn't found in the variables object for the current execution context, it can look in the variables object of the parent execution context. 
            * Important to remember that you can utilize this, but it will affect performance. 

Common Problems
* Understanding errors: 
    * If a JS statement encounters an error, then it throws an exception. The interpreter stops at the exception and looks for exception-handling code. 
    * When an error object is created, it will have the following properties: (viewable in the console)
        * name / type of error
        * message / description 
        * fileNumber / name of the js file
        * lineNumber / line number of error 
    * Seven types of built in error objects in JavaScript.
        * Error : Generic error - the other errors are all based upon this error
        * SyntaxError: Syntax has not been followed // 
            * typo
            * mismatched quotes
            * missing closing bracket
            * missing comma within an array
            * malformed property name
        * ReferenceError: tried to reference a variable that is not declared or within scope 
        * TypeError: An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced. 
            * oftentimes caused by trying to use an object or method that doesn't exist. 
        * RangeError: Numbers not in an acceptable range
            *  
        * URIError: encodeURI(), decodeURI(), and similar methods used incorrectly
            * If the following characters are not escaped in URI's, they will cause an error: 
                * / , ? , & , # , : , ; 
        * EvalError: eval() function used incorrectly. 

Handling Errors
* Handle errors using try, catch, throw, and finally statements. 
* Ask yourself: 
    * Where is the problem? Narrow down the area where the problem seems to be. 
        * Check how far the script is running. 
        * Use breakpoints where things are going wrong. 
            * Breakpoints help you see if the variables around them have the values you would expect them to. 
        * Break down or break out parts of the code to test smaller pieces of the functionality.
            * write values of the variables into the console
            * Call functions from the console to check and see if they are returning what you would expect them to. 
            * Check if objects exist and have the methods or properties that you expect them to. 
        * Check out how many parameters for a function, or the number of items in an array. 
* Stepping through code using breakpoints
* Conditional Breakpoints (continue if condition is true...) 
* "debugger" keyword, when entered into the console will insert a breakpoint
* Handling exceptions: try, catch and finally (page 480,481)
                                Try {
                                    // try to execute this code                                 } catch (exception) {
                                    // if there is an exception, run this code                                 } finally {
                                    // this always gets executed                                 }
* Throwing your own errors (482-483)
